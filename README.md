## The problem Mars Delight solves

The near future is going to be highly dynamic, we will have inter-planetary lives and will need ways to enhance our experience of eating and cuisines with easy methods that comply with the earthly methods as well. We have built such a system that works on ETHEREUM+POLYGON+SOLANA blockchains. It can also be extended as a use case in the gaming as well as virtual-reality purposes in the WEB3 domain.


## Challenges we ran into

-Using multi-chain protocols and highly dynamic architectures of different blockchains.

-Integration of all codes in a single repository.

-Writing the code for Rust and Solidity smart contracts.
